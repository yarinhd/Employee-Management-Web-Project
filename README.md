# People-Managing-Web-Project


## Version
This is a prototype version of the project. Please note that the current implementation may not include all intended features or be fully optimized, as it is still under development. The final version of the project will not be available to the general public.

## Description
This project serves as a comprehensive tool for organizing and maintaining employee data within a company. It integrates with authentication and employee data services, allowing for efficient management based on the company's hierarchy. Managers and team leaders can upload files, take notes, and more for their subordinates, capturing their achievements, strengths, weaknesses, and career development.

The information can be made visible or hidden from the employees, depending on the manager's preferences. This tool plays a crucial role when a new team leader joins a team, as it helps them understand and connect with each team member based on their work history, which is documented through notes and files.
